# KryptonBlockchain

Welcome to Krypton, a new vision for the internet.  We believe that privacy is a right not a options. ISP have a virtual monopoly over your data doing with it as they please. We are creating a decentralized isp. This gives freedom and power to the individual and takes it away from the big corporations that are ISPs. We plan on creating nodes all around the world which indivual host themselve they're preventing a large database of data for you to be tracked.

# Authentication Network

This represent how authentication will work on the Krypton Blockchain network and how we would utilize blockchain in it. Nodes are the devices that users will place in their home to share their internet imaginge it like user owned isp base stations. This is key to the network and these will MOST likely be built using a raspberry pi but this is not confirmed yet. 
# If you need any clarifications or anything is confusing please make an issue and we will try our best to update the DFD.
More info coming soon.
